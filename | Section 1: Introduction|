*Introducion To Cloud Computing* 

First, what is cloud computing in general?
//Cloud computing offers services like databases, servers, storage, etc., eliminating the need for an on premise network by using the internet. 

// The three major cloud computing platofrms are AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Database. 

!The main primary focus is going to be Azure cloud service!

*Azure Free Account*

If you want to start using azure resources, you can create an Azure free account 
//You get some services for free for a 12 month period + a $200 credit that you can use for 30 days.
Anything the isnt included with the azure free account and you use, it will use the credit you recived.
//All you need to ccreate a free account is a phone number + a debit/credit card registered on the account
and a microsoft pr github account. 

*Creating an Azure Free Account*
//You first need to sign in with a using a microsoft account
//Solve the puzzle verifying if youre not a robot 
//Specify which region you live closest too 
//Enter your first and last name with your phone number attached. 
// verify the code sent to your mobile device 
//agree to the customer agreement 
// attached a method of payment 
// click sign up

*Tour around the portal* 

!Every time you log into a free account, it'll remind you of your free credits for 30 days!
//When you create an account, you will also have a subscription in place as well. This is where the costs of the services will reside. 
//Azure subscriptions are used for billing purposes. 

*Key Terms* 

//A "service" is a functionality that azure gives you some permissions over. For example, creating a virtual machine is labled as a service in Azure.
//When you create something in Azure, it's known as a "resource" in Azure. 
!Resources need to be linked to a subscription since this iis where the bill resides!
!Every resource also needs to be attached to a "resource group"!
//"Resource groups" are used to logically group your resources.
//When you create a resource, the first things that are asked is for a subscription and a resource group. 

*Lab - Creating a resource group* 
//Clicking on the resource group link will automatically take you to all your exsisting resource groups on the account.
//Hit the "Create" button to start the process of creating a resource group
//It will ask to attach a subscription to the new resource group.
//Create a simple name for the resource group.
//Next, it will ask for the region you want to create the resource group.
!Azure has a global infrastruture containing 60+ regions for your resources to reside in! 
//Next, It will ask if you want to lable this resource group with any existing tags.
//Click the "Review + Create" button
//It will preform a quick validation of the resource group
//Click the "Create" button to deploy a brand new resource group 
// You will recive a notification on the new resource group creation 

*Summary of What we Learnt*
What is Cloud Computing? 

"Delivery"
The delivery of the cloud computing services like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, etc.

"Cloud"
The deliveray of these services done over the internet 

"Payment Model" 
Here, you pay as much as you use. 

"Be ahead of the competition"
allows for faster, innovation, flexibility, and faster delivery of services 

"Traditional Data Centers"

//With cloud computing, companies dont need to invest in a traditional datacenter.
//Less management, dont need to manage large machines
//Less investment, dont need to invest in hardware
//Less operations, dont need to invest in in managing the datacenter 
//Focus on business

"Growth of cloud computing platforms 
//World wide end-user spending on public cloud services forecast for 2021 -> 23.1% growth in 2021 

"Microsoft Azure" 
//Microsoft Azure provides functionality that you can use in the form of a service. 
//You can use the service to create a resource as part of your account 
//Subscription used as a payment
//"Resource group" This is used to to logically group resources.
